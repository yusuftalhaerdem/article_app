# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

commands. This will make the app run on your local machine(by default, at port 3000).

This app clone of `https://demo.realworld.io/`. You can visit their website and may try your clone as well.
You may visit their github page `https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld` for better understanding.
I used `https://api.realworld.io/api-docs/` api for backend requests, which uses swagger.

Note: I am currently working this project so there may be some uncompleted updates in the project.
