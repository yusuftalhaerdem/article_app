# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

commands. This will make the app run on your local machine(as default, at port 3000).

This app very similiar to `https://demo.realworld.io/`. You can visit their website to compare or
check their github page `https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld` for better understanding.

I used `https://api.realworld.io/api-docs/` api for backend requests.

Note: Article View and commenting part is undone at the moment. In couple weeks I plan to complete this project.
